# NYC Citi Bike Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose

    1. The length of time that bikes are checked out for all rides and genders
    2. The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week 
    3. The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
